#### The claim that security competition and war between the great powers have been purged from the international system is wrong.

For example,

- even though the Soviet threat has disappeared, the United States still maintains about one hundred thousand troops in Europe and roughly the same number in Northeast Asia.
- almost every European state, including the United Kingdom and France, still harbors deep-seated, albeit muted, fears that a Germany unchecked by American power might behave aggressively
- fear of Japan in Northeast Asia is probably even more profound, and it is certainly more frequently expressed.
- the possibility of a clash between China and the United States over Taiwan is hardly remote.

This is not to say that such a war is likely, but the possibility reminds us that the threat of great-power war has not disappeared.

#### Great powers are rarely content with the current distribution of power; on the contrary, they face a constant incentive to change it in their favor.

Great powers are rarely content with the current distribution of power; on the contrary, they face a constant incentive to change it in their favor.

Thus, a great power will defend the balance of power when looming change favors another state, and it will try to undermine the balance when the direction of change is in its own favor.

#### Why do great powers behave this way? My answer is that the structure of the international system forces states which seek only to be secure nonetheless to act aggressively toward each other.

Three features,

1. the absence of a central authority that sits above states and can protect them from each other
2. the fact that states always have some offensive military capability
3. the fact that states can never be certain about other states’ intentions

Given this fear—which can never be wholly eliminated—states recognize that the more powerful they are relative to their rivals, the better their chances of survival.

#### If China becomes an economic powerhouse it will almost certainly translate its economic might into military might and make a run at dominating Northeast Asia.

Whether China is democratic and deeply enmeshed in the global economy or autocratic and autarkic will have little effect on its behavior, because democracies care about security as much as non-democracies do, and hegemony is the best way for any state to guarantee its own survival.

In short, China and the United States are destined to be adversaries as China's power grows.
